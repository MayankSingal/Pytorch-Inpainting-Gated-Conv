# Pytorch-Inpainting-Partial-Gated-Conv
An attempt at a PyTorch implementation of Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions, with the Partial Convolution replaced by gated convolution.

The results are far from those mentioned in the paper as of now. Going on a hyperparameter search adventure soon. Wish me luck.
